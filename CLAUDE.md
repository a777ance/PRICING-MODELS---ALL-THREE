# CLAUDE.md

Briefing for Claude Code. Read this first; [README.md](README.md) holds this repo's full
content. This file carries the portfolio-wide A777ance conventions (below); repo-specific
detail lives in the README.

## House style: ordering & typography

These conventions apply across **every** A777ance repo — current and future. (Adopted 2026-06-05.)

- **Time-based content reads newest-first (reverse-chronological).** Logs, changelogs,
  decision logs (ADR / FIN), known-issues and issue trackers, FAQs, metrics and review
  logs, and "Handled For You" entries all lead with the most recent item. Apply this
  within the time-based *section* even when the whole file isn't time-based.
- **Alphabetical lists run Z → A** (descending).
- **Walkthroughs: reverse the blocks, keep the steps.** In a step-by-step guide, present
  the major sections/blocks in reverse order (last block first — it helps "block" the
  work), but keep the numbered steps *within* each block in forward order so every
  procedure stays followable. A walkthrough's table of contents mirrors the reversed
  block order. **Never renumber** — step and stage numbers stay fixed, so the intended
  execution order is always readable from the numbers.
- **Font: Gill Sans MT everywhere.** Every surface — customer-facing or internal — uses
  Gill Sans MT. Web/CSS stack:
  `'Gill Sans MT', 'Gill Sans', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif`.

## Bifrost — active command schema (loads every session)

**Bifrost** is the A777ance command-composition schema — a keyboard-spatial notation
(`~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ()` swept left→right, each glyph an *archetype* fulfilled by slash
commands + a plain-language sub-prompt). It is **active from the first token of every
session, in every repo:** adopt the `~` lazy-anchor posture — fire the first token ASAP
(the *model* stays high), let continuity coalesce mid-flight — and read Bifrost notation
per the schema whenever used.

- **Backbone:** `~` continuity/lazy-anchor · `` ` `` descriptor · `!` cargo (a *manifest* —
  not executed on loading) · `@` source (read from) · `#` repo/destination (write to) ·
  `$` sanity · `%` compliance · `^` cars/lanes · `&` rotary (also the sequential form) ·
  `*` stop signal (red by default) · `()` governance (release conditions). Keys 1–4
  **Preload** form a complete manifest — *what · from where · to where · against what*.
- **`*` cuts the road into Dispensations** — bounded, self-governing chunks. Governance has
  three outcomes: satisfied → green · **re-flagged** → return upstream via `&` (this is what
  lets a fixed string produce unbounded output) · unsatisfiable → eject to the shoulder.
- **The one-way door:** `~` rushes the reasoning, `*` gates the *effects* — anything
  irreversible (publish, deploy, send, push) rides past a light, which is exactly what makes
  the lazy start affordable.
- **Cars:** explicit `^` beats inferred. With no `^`, `!`'s command arity instantiates lanes
  1:1; with `^` present, `^` sets the lanes and `!`'s commands are the per-lane pipeline.
- **Guardrails survive a keyboard-mash:** `~` continuity, `$` sanity, `%` compliance — plus
  `*()` **governance**, the only one that repeats at every chunk boundary. `+` / repetition =
  more; `-` inverts into a stress test.
